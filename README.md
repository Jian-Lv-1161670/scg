设计决策

讨论设计 和开发应用时 所做的决策
what design option you weighted up

why you designed your app the way that you did,

your descision about the routes, tempaltes, navigation, broad layout, etc, that you made.


For example, when the edit button is clicked on a page, 
does that open a different template for editing or does it use the same template with IF statements to enable the editing? 
Did you use GET or POST to request and send data, and how and why? These are two examples, 
you do not have to include them in your own discussion. You will have considered many design possibilities;
 write in plain language about your own personal decisions.

Database questions: Refer to the supplied scg_local.sql file to answer the following questions:
1.
What SQL statement creates the customer table and defines its fields/columns? (Copy and paste the relevant lines of SQL.)
2.
Which line of SQL code sets up the relationship between the customer and booking tables?
3.
Which lines of SQL code insert details into the sites table?
4.
Suppose that as part of an audit trail, the time and date a booking was added to the database needed to be recorded. What fields/columns would you need to add to which tables? Provide the table name, new column name and the data type. (Do not implement this change in your app.)
5.
Suppose the ability for customers to make their own bookings was added. Describe two different changes that would be needed to the data model to implement this. (Do not implement these changes in your app.)
